# **Steganography Web Application**

A comprehensive **web-based steganography platform** that allows users to securely hide and extract secret messages within images, audio, documents, and videos using advanced digital watermarking techniques.

---

## 🌟 Features

* **Multi-format support** → Images, Audio, Documents, Videos
* **AES-256 encryption** with password protection
* **Secure server-side processing** with file validation
* **Modern UI** with responsive Bootstrap 5 design
* **Fast encoding/decoding** optimized for large files
* **Automatic file cleanup** after processing

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

* **Backend** → Flask, Python, OpenCV, Pillow, PyDub, Wave, MoviePy, PyPDF2, python-docx, Cryptography
* **Frontend** → Bootstrap 5, Font Awesome, Custom CSS, Vanilla JavaScript
* **Utilities** → FFmpeg for audio/video processing

---

## 📦 Installation & Setup

**Requirements**

* Python 3.9+
* pip (Python package manager)
* FFmpeg installed and added to PATH

**Steps**

1. Clone the repository
2. Create and activate a virtual environment
3. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
4. Install FFmpeg (Windows: `winget install Gyan.FFmpeg`, Mac: `brew install ffmpeg`, Linux: `sudo apt install ffmpeg`)
5. Run the application with `python app.py` and visit `http://localhost:5000`

---

## 🐳 Docker Setup (Optional)

For quick setup, you can build and run the project with Docker:

* Build the image with `docker build -t stegapp .`
* Run the container with `docker run -p 5000:5000 stegapp`
* Access the app at `http://localhost:5000`

## 🚀 Usage Guide

### Hiding Data

1. Choose the carrier file type (Image, Audio, Document, Video)
2. Upload the carrier file
3. Enter the secret message
4. Optionally add a password for encryption
5. Process and download the stego file

### Extracting Data

1. Select the file type
2. Upload the stego file
3. Enter password if required
4. Extract and view the hidden message

## 📡 Planned API Endpoints

* `POST /api/hide` → Hide secret in carrier file
* `POST /api/extract` → Extract hidden data
* `GET /api/status` → Health check

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

* Maximum upload size: 50MB
* Strict MIME type validation
* Path sanitization against traversal attacks
* Automatic deletion of uploaded files
* Robust error handling for safety

## 📊 Performance Metrics

| Operation         | Avg Time      | Max File Size |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Image Processing  | 0.5–2 seconds | 10MP images   |
| Audio Processing  | 2–5 seconds   | 10 min audio  |
| Document Handling | 1–3 seconds   | 50-page PDF   |
| Video Processing  | 10–30 seconds | 2 min video   |
